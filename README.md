Anyways, i code for fun, and i like learning new stuff. Currently a sophomore in college going for . . . can you guess what degree? Of course, computer science and engineering, yup. If you didn't guess that then idk what to tell you.

Languages i'm best at: Python.

Languages i'm okay at: Maybe Java, syntax is easy to pick back up, but haven't touched it in ages. Solidity, but only recently picked it up.

Languages i can act like i know but only look at a few times: Javascript, C++, SQL, and maybe some other random shit i might have made a program with. 

This is my more lowkey account for more lowkey things that i like doing on the side not connected to my main accounts at all, so i guess enjoy that.
