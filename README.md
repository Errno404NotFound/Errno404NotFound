Anyways, i code for fun, and i like learning new stuff. Currently a sophomore in college going for . . . can you guess what degree? Of course, computer science and engineering, yup. If you didn't guess that then idk what to tell you.

### Languages i'm best at: 
  * Python.

### Languages i'm currently learning: 
  * Solidity for ETH blockchain related development. 
  * C for a cool systems programming class. 
  * RISC-V Assembly for a cool systems architecture class.

### Languages i'm okay at: 
  * Maybe Java, syntax is easy to pick back up, but haven't touched it in ages.

### Languages i can act like i know but only look at a few times: 
  * Javascript for some discord.js, and some node.js. 
  * HTML/CSS for some random web dev stuff at some point.
  * C++ for who knows what reason at this point. 
  * SQL because i wanted to learn how DBs worked, but gave up on that. 
  * Maybe some other random shit i might have made a program with or watched vids about like brainfuck. 

### Languages that i learned in school for who knows what reason: 
  * Scheme/R5RS. Why/

This is my more lowkey account for more lowkey things that i like doing on the side not connected to my main accounts at all, so i guess enjoy that.
